# Patient Matching Challenge

Office Ally is currently working on an algorithm which could match Patient data from various sources to identify whether it is the same patient.  We would like hackers to come up with creative ways to tackle this challenge, and achieve as close to 100% accuracy as possible.  We have provided a sample list of patients for hackers to check their accuracy against.  

To be considered eligible for the prize, your solution must achieve at least 90% accuracy (which our sample SQL code does).  Hardcoding will not be eligible.


# Steps
Utilizing this and the Test Patient Data provided, perform the following:

1. Store the "Patient matching data" CSV data into a database.  It can be any database that you feel comfortable working with.  This data was extracted from Microsoft SQL Server.
2. Once the database is created and patient data imported, you can use the "PatientMatchPOC" SQL proof of concept provided to run some tests to verify the accuracy of the current algorithm.
    -In the CSV file, the Group ID shows which patients you should be matching together - aka, all the patients in group 1 is the same person.
    -You'll notice a lot of the data looks similar - aka Group ID 2 looks like Group ID 1.  This is a false positive - Group ID 2 should not be Group ID 1.
3. Now, create an application based version of the SQL proof of concept.  Use Python or C# (ASP.Net) to complete this.  
    - Your application basically does what the SQL POC does.
4. Once you have created an application that mirrors the SQL POC, you can hook up the database to your application, and verify your accuracy is the same as the SQL POC.
5. Finally, what else can you do to improve the accuracy of the Patient Matching in your application?  Think of other algorithms and theorems you can utilize the data to perform comparisons.
    - The proof of concept utilizes hash tokens and Soundex tokens.  Are there any other ways to improve matching accuracy?
